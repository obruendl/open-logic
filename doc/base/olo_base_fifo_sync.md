VHDL Source: [olo_base_fifo_sync](../../src/base/vhdl/olo_base_fifo_sync.vhd)

## Description

This component implements a synchronous FIFO (same clock for write and read port). 

The memory is described in a way that it utilizes RAM resources (Block-RAM or distributed RAM) available in FPGAs with commonly used tools. For this purpose [olo_base_ram_sdp](./olo_base_ram_sdp.md) is used.

The FIFO is a fall-through FIFO and has AXI-S interfaces on read and write side.

The RAM behavior (read-before-write or write-before-read) can be selected. This allows efficiently implementing FIFOs for different technologies (some technologies implement one, some the other behavior).

## Generics

| Name            | Type      | Default | Description                                                  |
| :-------------- | :-------- | ------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Widht_g         | positive  | -       | Number of bits per FIFO entry (word-width)                   |
| Depth_g         | positive  | .       | Number of FIFO entries                                       |
| AlmFullOn_g     | boolean   | false   | If set to true, the *AlmFull* (almost full) status flag is generated (otherwise it is omitted) |
| AlmFullLevel_g  | natural   | -       | Level to generate *AlmFull* flag at. <br>Has no effect if *AlmFullOn_g* = false |
| AlmEmptyOn_g    | boolean   | false   | If set to true, the *AlmEmpty* (almost empty) status flag is generated (otherwise it is omitted) |
| AlmEmptyLevel_g | natural   | -       | Level to generate *AlmEmpty* flag at. <br>Has no effect if *AlmEmptyOn_g* = false |
| RamStyle_g      | string    | "auto"  | Through this generic, the exact resource to use for implementation can be controlled. This generic is applied to the attributes *ram_style* and *ramstyle* which vendors offer to control RAM implementation.<br>For details refer to the description in [olo_base_ram_sdp](./olo_base_ram_sdp.md). |
| RamBehavior_g   | string    | "RBW"   | "RBW" = read-before-write, "WBR" = write-before-read<br/>For details refer to the description in [olo_base_ram_sdp](./olo_base_ram_sdp.md). |
| ReadyRstState_g | std_logic | '1'     | Controls the status of the *In_Ready* signal in during reset.<br> Choose '1' for minimal logic on the (often timing-critical) *In_Ready* path. <br |

## Interfaces

## Architecture

No detailed architecture documentation is required for a FIFO. The behavior of the FIFO is sufficiently defined without details about the internals being required.
